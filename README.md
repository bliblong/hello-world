# hello-world

Hello there,

I'm Breen Liblong, and I am a strong proponent of functional languages.

I have 30+ years experience as a developer, working in a variety of positions from developer
to senior technical management at the exec level.

My career focus has been on leading edge product development using novel, sometimes esoteric technologies
to solve real world problems.

My latest focus is learning to use Docker and lightweight container technologies.
